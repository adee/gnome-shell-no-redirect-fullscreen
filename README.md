Don't do fullscreen window redirection extension

Gnome Shell 3.16 redirects fullscreen windows by default. This can cause tearing in fullscreen games and also creates glithes in the workspace swithcing effect(e.g. you swith to a workspace with the fullscreen application->animation gets half-rendered only).

This extension disables this behavior.
